# Documentation Writing Standards

## Using special characters

- Mention Breadcrumbs in backquotes, eg `Dashboard / Brands`.
- Define actions and button names, eg `Action name`.
- For entity names, panel names, field names and all other system-specific names – first letter of each word should be capitalized, eg Product Category, but Product data record. 
- Use double quotes only in exceptional cases, where other cases from these standards cannot be applied.
- Single quote can be used only as apostrophe, do not use it in other cases.
- Use "–", not "-", if you need a "dash" character, eg "Field Name – description of the field name". 
- Avoid using other special characters.

## Using double quotes

- To indicate words used ironically, with reservations, or in some unusual way, eg "right" choice.
- To set off words used as words, terms, options etc, eg the term "Entity", "dash" charakter, select option "Relationship".
- For module names, eg the module "Advanced data types".
- To state options in select lists, eg please choose "Relationship" as a type.

## Internal comments
- Internal comments can be used as reminder, for review comments about what should be improved, fixing "To Dos" etc.
- use HTML comment markup to write internal comments, these are not visible to the readers, eg 
```
<!-- To Do 
1. add reference to xxxx
2. add description about yyy
-->
```

## File naming

- Use speaking file names, eg filter-apply-and-reset-buttons.jpg, NOT filter4.jpg.
- Use only small latters in file names, eg filder.jpg, NOT Filter.jpg.
- Do not use spaces, exchange spaces with "-" to separate works, eg reset-button.jpg.
- Usually do not use underscore "\_" in the file names. Use it only in excentional cases to explicitly emphasize something in the file name, eg reset-button_2022.jpg.

## General recommendations

- Do not write words which can be deleted without losing the sense for the sentence.
- Do not write sentences which can be deleted in full without losing the sense for the sentence.
- Do not describe what is already so obvious, like "see the picture bellow".
- Do not strart a note with "Please note" or with something similar.
- Do not use fully capitalized words, eg "PANEL".
- Use bold font to highlight important information, eg "**Channel** – is a destination for product information".
- Use italic font only to highlight something in a different matter if bold font is already used.
- Use relative hyperlinks.
- Do not use absolute hyperlinks.
- Use of HTML is allowed only in exceptional cased.
- Notes should be written in HTML syntax, eg "<!-- this is some note –>". Notes can be used in reviews and to define "to do's" for improving of the Documentation in the future.
- Use multi-level headings.
- Use tables to highlight plain information structures.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Avoid using bullet points for multi-line sentences.
- Use file names without extensions as labels for your images (which are in brackets), eg \[attribute-tab-create\]\(../_assets/user-guide/attribute_tab/attribute-tab-create.png\)
