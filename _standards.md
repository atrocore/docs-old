# Documentation Writing Standards

## Using special characters

- Mention Breadcrumbs in backquotes, eg `Dashboard / Brands`.
- Define actions and button names, eg `Action name`.
- For entity names, panel names, field names and all other system-specific names – first letter of each word should be capitalized, eg Product Category, but Product data record. 
- Use double quotes only in exceptional cases, where other cases from these standards cannot be applied.
- Do not use single quotes, can be used only as apostrophe.
- Use double quotes to indicate words used ironically, with reservations, or in some unusual way, eg "right" choice.
- Use double quotes to set off words used as words, terms etc, eg the term "Entity" defines...
- Use "–", not "-", if dash is needed, eg "Field Name – description of the field name". 

## General recommendations

- Do not write words which can be deleted without losing the sense for the sentence.
- Do not write sentences which can be deleted in full without losing the sense for the sentence.
- Do not describe what is already so obvious, like "see the picture bellow".
- Do not strart a note with "Please note" or with something similar.
- Do not use fully capitalized words, eg "PANEL".
- Use bold font to highlight important information, eg "**Channel** – is a destination for product information".
- Use italic font only to highlight something in a different matter if bold font is already used.
- Use relative hyperlinks.
- Do not use absolute hyperlinks.
- Use of HTML is allowed only in exceptional cased.
- Notes should be written in HTML syntax, eg <!-- this is some note –>. Notes can be used in reviews and to define "to do's" for improving of the Documentation in the future.
- Use multi-level headings.
- Use tables to highlight plain information structures.
- Use bullet points for lists.
