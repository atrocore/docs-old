# Documentation Writing Standards

Define Breadcrumbs like "Dashboard / Brands".
Define actions and button names like `Action name`.
For entity names, panel names, field names and all other system-specific names â€“ first letter of each word should be capitalized. 

## General recommendations

- Do not write words which can be deleted without loosing the sence.
- Do not describe what is already so obvious, like "see the picture bellow".
