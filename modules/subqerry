When adding filters to your search you can add additional subfilters. To add subfilter you have to filter data in the popup menu (see picture below) and then select "Select all results".

The search will be shown as on the picture below:

This way is better then selecting all appropriate results to subfilter because:
1) it is faster, especially when you have a lot of results
2) whenever database is updated you do not have to manually update the filter - it is automatically updated according to new information
