Ldap authentication 

The “ldap” module allows to authenticate corporate users to your AtroСore, AtroPIM or AtroDAM system. Thanks to the module, you can upload a list of users that can login to AtroСore or AtroPIM system. They then use their personal username and common password.

Module location

After the module installation, a new Ldap authentication configuration group is added to the AtroPIM administration page. To configure the Ldap menu, go to Administration/Authentication and see LDAP menu. From there you can change module settings.
