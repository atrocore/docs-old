# Import/Export Feeds: REST API

Import and Export Feeds can also be used as REST API endpoints with a flat data structure. So, if need need to use a custom REST API endpoint just configure a data feed for it.

## REST API in `Export Feeds` Module

To use this api, you need an active exportFeed with a valid code. Then you can do a `GET` request to `/api/v1/ExportFeed/action/EasyCatalog?code=ExportFeedCode&offset=0`.
This will return data configured in the ExportFeed.

## REST API in `Import Feeds` Module

To use this api, you need an active importFeed with a valid code. Then you can do a `POST` request to `/api/v1/ImportFeed/action/EasyCatalog`. 
In the body of the request we have 2 parameters.

- `code` – the importFeed code
- `json` – an array of object that contains values to update
