When translating attributes and titles, you can translate titles into all languages that are installed in your system. You can set main language and translation rules (see photo below) in Administration/Translations page.

When editing or creating entity attribute or title you can check "translate automatically" checkbox - it will automatically translate data from main language to current box when you press this button and whenever there is a change in a source box. Or you can press "translate" button to do it only when you want.
The "translated" checkbox shows that the name was translated not manually printed. You can uncheck it of you want.

If the language you want to translate to does not exist in translation rules when translating module will just copy information from a source box without translating it.
