# Advanced Classification

The "Advanced Classification" module allows the user to create product families with hierarchical interconnection. Product family is a group of products with common features defined as attributes. The advanced classification function facilitates product family creation and management as well as product filtering. The module enables you to manage product families that are similar but slightly differ from each other. 

## Product family creation and configuration

To create a new product family go to the `Products > Product family` and click `Create product family` button.

- **Code** - this field should be unique for each product family.
- **Parent** - define the parent element from which this product family will be inherited.
