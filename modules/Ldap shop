The LDAP module allows you to control AtroCore users via your own DAP server. AtroCore always create user records, so If new user is added via LDAP, a new record for him will be created in AtroCore software autoamatically. For the new users a default role and a group is assigned. Thease can still be changed via AtroCore administration.
