In an "Overview" window you can set an import's name, description, how many successful import jobs (imports that were successful) will be stored (remembered by the system). Also you can set what to do with the data imported (create new, update, delete, create and update, create and delete, update and delete or create, update and delete).
The next window (Import data settings) depends from the type of the source you import from. You can import from file, ftp or database.
For a file and ftp csv and excel formats are supported. Also you will need to select a route to the source.
"Feed settings" window is to set how to determine data in your source. It defines how the data is structured in the data source and allows the system to load it without errors.
When you save import feed you will see "Configurator" menu. There you set what soureses of the PIM data fields are (see picture below). You do not have to set identical names of source and imported fields and don't have to import all the data.
