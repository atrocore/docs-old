When editing attributes you can set default value, scope and required checkbox (see picture below in blue square).

Default value - sets default value for an attribute. For the products you want another value you can change it in the product page.

Scope - sets channel in which attribute value can be seen (you choose the channel in a "Channel" field right to the "Scope" field). By default attribute value is seen in all channels.

Required checkbox - when it is checked the attribute value cannot be empty. By default it is unchecked.
