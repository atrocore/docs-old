The "Name" menu states for the name of an asset type, "sort order" for the order in witch it will be shown. "Types to exclude" is a rule that prevents some asset types be presented together in one asset. 
If "Assign automatically" checkbox is checked, all new asset will be checked to have this asset type according to the validation rules.
Validation rules set rule or rules that determine is an asset appropriate for this asset type. When a validation rule is changed, all assets are automatically recalculated according to their validation rules (see photo below).
